                                <h3 class="major">What is Life</h3>  
                                <blockquote>
                                    When I was a teenager, one of the most striking question that came in my mind was, “What is the purpose of our consciousness and why are we even alive in the first place?” </br>
                                    I was overwhelmed by this thought and it stuck in my mind for many days and I desperately tried to figure out the sensible answer to this question, which satisfies my intellect of that time, and I figured 
                                    out a descent answer also. At that time, I thought that life is all about making it worth of living, it is something that we need to make great at the end of the day.</br>
                                    But now look back I realized something, it is our perspective and our experiences that makes us how we understand the whole concept of life. As our experiences grow our perspective of life also improves. 
                                    Now, its on a person that how much experience he has gained in his life time and how he understands the outcomes of those experiences, so for every person the meaning of life is different and one can agree 
                                    or disagree with his/her point of view, depending on one’s experiences.</br>
                                    Now, according to me at this stage of my lifetime, I perceive life as an open opportunity to gain as much experience as I can to improve my-self, life is like phases to me and different phases requires 
                                    different understanding level, the phase I am going through right now, asks me to learn as much as I can so that I can make a perfect version  of myself. The more I experience I get right now; more it will 
                                    help me in the next phase of my life and the purpose of life will become clearer in my mind.

                                <h3 class="major">The Real Love</h3>
                                <blockquote>
                                    We as humans talk about love and sympathy, there are movies made, plays written which glorifies the concept of love, but what I think of it is that it all is not real in the 
                                    practical world because there always comes a time when the person you think you love will betray you or you have to betray the person. It all just depends on the type conditions 
                                    and situation a person is in.</br>
                                    The concept of love is so much glorified by the movies and plays throughout the course of history that becomes hard for me to believe that this type of love can even exist, 
                                    one who creates a movie or a play make the audience to see and imagine the thoughts which they cannot experience in there real life because this is the only way one can make his/her 
                                    creation appealing to the mases. But this some how also affects our understanding and the way we perceive a particular concept showcased in the play/film. Now, due to such glorifications 
                                    one is never happy in his/her actual relationships because this is not working out for them as they have imagined it should be. This is the reason why many feel depressed in or after the 
                                    relationship is over.</br>
                                    People who live in this delusion either never understands the concept of love or take very long time to understand it, but once they understand it, they know that the real love is nothing 
                                    like what is portrayed from ages. If people understand this concept, they are always happy together, otherwise they are in continuous search of someone special in there. So, this brings us 
                                    to the point that love is not something which comes automatically, it is developed due the course of time with understanding, faith and investment.</br>
                                    As it rightly said by Rabbi Dessler, “people often make mistake by thinking that you give to those whom you love, but the real answer is you love those to whom you give.”
