							<h3>Sound to Image Conversion</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/s2i.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200"/></span>
							<p>
								This project is based on the new approach and idea of pixel encodations from the sound. basically the techniques will help in converting 1D data to a 2D data. 
								The basic approach is explained here. 
								The image we will be making can be of n by n dimensions for example 128 by 128, and in addition to this, it will be including the 3 color channels i.e. RGB.
								So in all, it will be a numpy array of n,n,3 dimensions...
								In order to make this we need to obtain the 3 types of information from the sound sample, which can be done by using the following encoding technique ( #proposed_by_me ) -->
								F --> Max. Frequency in the sound sample or the filtered sound sample i.e. noise removed sample.
								A --> Max Amplitude in that filtered Sound Sample.
								L --> Length of that sound Sample.
								I chose thees three properties because converting the back of that image to the sound will be much easier if we have this information encoded into the channels itself.
								Now, let us suppose we have a soundtrack of length L in the time domain and we want to make a 128 by a 128-dimensional image so we need to sample that sound in 128x128 = 16384 samples.
								These segmented samples will be used to extract the 3 defined FAL values from them and once these are extracted then we will be placing this linear array information F, A, L into the 
								image by using a special mathematical continuous looping technique, which is much efficient than linear arrangement.
								The link for this technique and utilization can be accessed by clicking on the button below below:
								<ul class="actions">
									<li><a href="https://youtu.be/3s7h2MHQtxc" class="button">Hilbert Curves</a></li>
								</ul>

								Also, this will be fun to see if we can recover the same sound from the generated image and if the image generated can make any sense or what sounds make what kind of image with this encoding.
								It will also be interesting to see if one/i can also come out with different encoding techniques/methods/algorithms in future.

							<h3>Non-Gaussian and Multiplicative Noise removal from Sattelite Images using Deeplearning</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/sattelite.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200"/></span>

								This is a project and a researchpaper idea, and is under study for now, there is not any theory proposed yet but will be updated soon.

							<h3>Covid-19</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/covid-19.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200"/></span>
							<p>
								This project is related to the field of Medical Image Processing where the classification of Chest X-ray images into three classes which are Normal, 
								Pneumonia and COVID-19 is done. The concepts of Image Processing, Computer Vision and Algorithms, Deep Learning and Machine Learning is used in this 
								project. Also, the future developments will include the optimization of algorithm to also work under low light conditions (like when the light source 
								is only head light or street light), improving the time of prediction and practical deployment of the project. By clicking on the button given below 
								you can see the current developments in my project that i have uploaded on github.

							<h3>Lung Cancer</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/lung_cancer.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200"/></span>
							<p>
								This project was a part of a internship that i did under my college during lockdown. In this project i with my partner first researched on 
								lungs segmentation from the radiograpich images by using watershed algorithm and then once we were sucessfull in segmenting the lungs from the image, we 
								tried three different networks and trained them to classify the given data into cancer and non cancer images of lungs.

							<h3>Text to Braille</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/braille.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="200"/></span>
							<p>
								The project is made for visually challanged people who know how to read the brails codes. The project was made using opencv and py tessaract for image processing 
								part in which the video input from the camera is first preprocessed to filter out the noise using open cv and then the image was given to the pytasserect pretrained
								model which then detected the letters from the image. afyer that the detected letters/ words/ sentences/ paragraphs were saved as a word document. then these words are
								serially transmitted to the arduino uno character by character which is then programed using C++ to move the servo motors according to the braille format of the characters.
								This project was made by in keeping in mind the idea that there should be an ease of acces of reading material to the vissualy challanged people.
								The github link of the project can be accessed by clicking on the link given below.

								This project is related to the 5G communication technology development. It is the research paper implementation 
								project in which i have trained a Deep Learning model to estimate the CSI (Channel State Information) for eMBB 
								(enhanced Mobile Broad Band) Channel by using the information from URLLC (Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communication) 
								Channel. This CSI is then used by the transmitter for making the beamforming weight vector for the transmitter antenna.
